# Wafi — IT Helpdesk Ticket Triage

Classifies an incoming IT support ticket into `{team, urgency}` so it can be
routed automatically. Built for the SDA-AIE-113 capstone.

## Quickstart (< 10 minutes)

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd wafi
make install        # editable install + dev deps
make test           # unit + integration + behavioural, coverage gate 80%
```

## Run the service

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts `wafi` on `http://localhost:8000` alongside a `redis` supporting
service. `wafi` waits for redis to report healthy before starting.
Configuration is passed via `WAFI_*` environment variables in
`docker-compose.yml` — see `.env.example` for the full list if running
without Docker.

## Try it

```bash
# valid request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "my vpn keeps dropping every few minutes"}'

# malformed request (unknown field -> 422)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "hello", "not_a_real_field": true}'

curl http://localhost:8000/health   # liveness
curl http://localhost:8000/ready    # readiness
```

## Architecture

```
src/wafi/
  domain/     pure business rules — no imports from any other layer
  service/    use-case orchestration, depends on domain + the classifier Protocol
  adapters/   concrete classifier + idempotency cache, implement Protocols via DI
  api/        FastAPI endpoints, config, logging — wires everything together at startup
```

The layering is enforced automatically by `import-linter` (`make lint`) —
`domain` cannot import from `service`, `adapters`, or `api`; the layers
contract in `pyproject.toml` enforces the full stack order.

The model is swappable: `wafi.adapters.classifier_protocol.TicketClassifier`
is the interface; `KeywordClassifier` is the current implementation, injected
into `TriageService` at startup (`src/wafi/api/app.py`).

## Testing

| Level | Location | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | domain policy + classifier logic in isolation |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | the real FastAPI app, via `TestClient` |
| Behavioural — invariance | `tests/behavioral/test_invariance.py` | an outage phrase **always** forces `urgent` |
| Behavioural — directional | `tests/behavioral/test_directional.py` | more affected users never **lowers** urgency |
| Behavioural — golden | `tests/behavioral/test_golden.py` + `golden/golden_cases.json` | live output matches a frozen reference set |

Fast gate (unit + behavioural, no Docker) finishes in well under 60s:
`make test-fast`.

## Extension: idempotency cache

An identical ticket (same text + `affected_users`) submitted twice returns
the same decision without being re-classified. Backed by Redis
(`RedisIdempotencyCache`), injected into `TriageService` the same way the
classifier is (constructor DI). Falls back to a no-op `NullCache` if
`REDIS_URL` isn't set, and fails open (logs a warning, treats as a
cache miss) if Redis is unreachable — a caching layer going down must never
take ticket triage down with it.

Try it (with `docker compose up`, which sets `REDIS_URL` for you):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "my vpn keeps dropping"}'
# run the exact same request again -> same team/urgency, and the response's
# "rationale" field will say "served from idempotency cache"
```

Tested in `tests/unit/test_triage_service_cache.py` (fake in-memory cache —
proves a cache hit skips the classifier) and
`tests/behavioral/test_idempotency_cache.py` (the real `RedisIdempotencyCache`
against `fakeredis`, no live Redis needed to run the test suite).

## Config, secrets & logging

Typed settings (`src/wafi/api/config.py`, `pydantic-settings`) fail fast:
an invalid `WAFI_LOG_LEVEL` or an unrecognized `WAFI_*` variable crashes the
process at startup instead of being silently ignored (`extra="forbid"`).
See `.env.example` for the full list — copy it to `.env` for local runs;
`.env` itself is gitignored and no real secret is ever committed.

Logs are structured JSON, one object per line, each correlated with the
request's `trace_id` (also returned in the `x-trace-id` response header and
the `/v1/predict` response body). Ticket text itself is never logged — only
its length and the resulting `team`/`urgency` — to avoid leaking personal
data a reporter may have included in the ticket.
